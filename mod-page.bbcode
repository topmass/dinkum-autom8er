[b][size=6]AUTOM8ER[/size][/b]
[b]MAKE YOUR DINKUM FACTORY DREAMS COME TRUE![/b]
Version 1.4.0 by topmass

Black Marble Path Tiles are used for conveyors by default - the config file allows you to change to any path you choose :)[/center]

[center][size=5][b]What's New in 1.4.0[/b][/size][/center]

[b]Fish Pond Automation[/b]
- Place a chest within 3 tiles of a fish pond and critters will automatically load from the chest into the food slot
- Roe is extracted into adjacent chests each morning
- Smart Breeding Hold: keeps 15 roe in the pond when fewer than 5 fish to allow breeding - once full (5 fish) all roe is extracted immediately
- Works with conveyor belt networks

[b]Bug Terrarium Automation[/b]
- Place a chest within 3 tiles of a bug terrarium and honey will automatically load from the chest into the food slot
- Cocoons are extracted into adjacent chests each morning
- Smart Breeding Hold: keeps 10 cocoons when fewer than 5 bugs to allow breeding - once full all cocoons are extracted
- Works with conveyor belt networks

[b]Auto Sorter Integration[/b]
- Auto Sorters now work as automation input/output chests
- When machines deposit items into an Auto Sorter it automatically fires those items to nearby chests that have matching items
- Exempt from KeepOneItem so it empties completely
- Smart batching prevents lag when many machines deposit at once
- Use as your machine output chest to auto-distribute products to sorted storage

[b]Black Crate / Black Chest = OUTPUT ONLY[/b]
- Black Wooden Crate and Black Wooden Chest are now output-only containers
- They receive outputs from machines but will never feed materials into machines
- The opposite of the white crate/chest input-only behaviour

[b]Auto Placer Support[/b]
- Auto Placers now function as standard automation chests for input and output

[b]Bug Fixes[/b]
- Fixed ghost chest creation near gacha machines that could cause items to vanish
- Fixed Auto Sorter only firing when manually opened by the player

[center][size=5][b]Features[/b][/size][/center]

[b][size=4]Machine Automation[/size][/b]
Place any chest or crate next to a machine - that's it!
- [b]Auto-Output:[/b] Machine finishes and the product goes straight into the adjacent chest
- [b]Auto-Input:[/b] Chest has valid materials? The machine reloads and starts again automatically
- Works with ALL processing machines: Furnaces, Stone Grinder, Grain Mill, BBQ, Camp Oven, Camp Fire, Keg, Table Saw, Charging Station, and more

[b][size=4]Conveyor Belt Networks[/size][/b]
Black Marble Path tiles form conveyor networks that route items between distant chests and machines:
- Place Black Marble Path in connected lines
- Machines adjacent to the path send outputs to any chest on the network
- Chests touching the path feed materials to any machine on the network
- Works with all automation features: machines, fish ponds, terrariums, crab pots, silos

[b][size=4]Special Chests[/size][/b]

[b]White Wooden Crate / White Wooden Chest = INPUT ONLY[/b]
- CAN feed materials into machines
- WON'T receive outputs from machines
- Paint a regular crate/chest white to create one (white paint drops in the mines)

[b]Black Wooden Crate / Black Wooden Chest = OUTPUT ONLY[/b]
- CAN receive outputs from machines
- WON'T feed materials into machines
- Paint a regular crate/chest black to create one

[b]Auto Sorter = Smart I/O[/b]
- Works as both input and output for automation
- Automatically fires items to nearby chests that already have matching items
- Exempt from KeepOneItem so it empties completely
- Great as a machine output to auto-distribute products to your sorted storage

[b]Auto Placer[/b]
- Functions as a standard automation chest (input + output)

[b][size=4]Fish Ponds[/size][/b]
Place a chest within 3 tiles of a fish pond:
- Auto-loads critters (underwater creatures) from chest into the food slot
- Extracts roe into adjacent chests each morning
- Smart Breeding Hold: keeps 15 roe when fewer than 5 fish to allow breeding (configurable)

[b][size=4]Bug Terrariums[/size][/b]
Place a chest within 3 tiles of a bug terrarium:
- Auto-loads honey from chest into the food slot
- Extracts cocoons into adjacent chests each morning
- Smart Breeding Hold: keeps 10 cocoons when fewer than 5 bugs to allow breeding (configurable)

[b][size=4]Crab Pots[/size][/b]
Place a chest within 2 tiles of crab pots (they sit in water so you need the extra reach):
- Auto-loads bait from chest into crab pots
- Caught fish and critters deposit to nearby chests on day change
- This pairs well with a mod that allows fish to stack!
[i]Chests can fill up quickly and traps will splash as normal if there is no room to output items. Feel free to add more than one chest to a conveyor array![/i]

[b][size=4]Silos[/size][/b]
Place a chest next to a silo:
- Automatically fills the silo with Animal Food from the chest
- Visual fill effect as it loads
- Configurable fill speed (1-5 per tick)
- Works with KeepOneItem (fills to 199 instead of 200)

[b][size=4]Day-Change Harvests[/size][/b]
These machines automatically harvest into nearby chests each morning:
- Bee Houses - Honey collection
- Key Cutters - Duplicated keys
- Worm Farms - Worm harvesting
- Crab Pots - Fish and critter collection
- Incubators load fertilized eggs automatically but are NEVER harvested - your chooks are safe!

[b]Basic Processing Station Automation[/b]
Place a container directly in front of any processing station. Add items and close the chest - machines start automatically and processed items transfer to the container.

[b]Auto Placer Setup[/b]
Autom8er works great with the Auto Placer!

[b]Conveyor Belt Network[/b]
Black Marble Path tiles connect machines to distant chests. Items route through the network automatically.

[b]White Crate - Input Only[/b]
The white crate feeds materials into all machines on the conveyor network but never receives outputs.

Place a chest next to a silo and watch it fill up automatically.
